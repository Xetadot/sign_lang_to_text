This repository contains the source code and resources for an AI Legal Assistant. The aim of this project is to develop an AI-powered legal assistant that can:

* Summarize legal documents in plain English or Bahasa Melayu.

* Highlight key clauses (e.g., termination, payment, liabilities).

* Flag potential risks with easy-to-understand warnings.


 # Code Setup

  1. Download the ZIP FILE

  2. Extract `placeholder` from the zip file to download.

  3. Open the extracted folder.

  4. Open the terminal`(Ctrl + ~)` and run:
     ```
     placeholder
     ```
     This will create a folder named `myenv` with your virtual environment. `myenv` can be replaced with any other name you wish.

  5. Activate the environment by running:
     ```
     \myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
     After this, your terminal should show `(myenv)` in green - this means you are in the virtual environment.

  6. Install the required libraries:
     ```
     pip install torch
     ```
     ```
     pip install numpy
     ```
     ```
     pip install opencv-python
     ```
     ```
